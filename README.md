README

This repository is designed to understand modify the existing code found at http://phytomorph.wisc.edu/download/HeckwolfPlantMethods2015/
The process will be broken up into a few processes.
Step 1: Code Analysis
	Run the code line by line to understand functionality
	Add comments as needed and identify 'chunks' of code
	Make a diagram of code functions and subroutines

Step 2: Code Restructuring
	Meet with Dr. Cook to discuss structure and plan for changes.
